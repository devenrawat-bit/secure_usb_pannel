#wmi is windows management instrumentations 
# 1. WMI kya karta hai?
# Windows ke system hardware/software info ko access karta hai.
# Hum usse query kar sakte hain: “Koi new USB storage device connected hua kya?”

# 2. Kaise detect karega?
# Hum WMI ke event listener ko bolenge:
# "Bhai koi bhi Win32_DeviceChangeEvent ho to bata dena."
# Fir hum check karenge ki kya woh device USB type hai.


🔐 Why OS always knows?

Windows OS ke paas Plug and Play (PnP) system hota hai
– har new hardware/device auto-detect ho jata hai

Drivers hote hain jo batate hain:
→ “Yeh kya device hai?”
→ “Kis port me laga?”
→ “VID/PID kya hai?”
→ etc.

Agar device laga, OS usko detect karega hi —
Aur phir Python ko bhi event mil jaayega.

OS ke permission ke bina koi bhi device system me access nahi le sakta.

Har device ko OS se:

Power supply

Driver support

Mounting access
lena padta hai.

Agar OS ko pata hi nahi chala, to:

OS driver load nahi karega

Device koi kaam nahi kar sakta

Python ya koi bhi program us device ko detect nahi kar sakta

device manager help in detecting the device which are internal and the external device to make confirm about the true value

✅ What does Status: OK mean in WMI?
The Status property comes from WMI's Win32_PnPEntity class, and here's what it tells you:

"OK" → The device is functioning properly according to Windows.

"Error" or other statuses → There’s a problem with the device like missing drivers, resource conflicts, etc.

⚠️ But: "OK" only means "Windows recognizes it and the driver is working."
It does not mean the device is safe or not malicious.
